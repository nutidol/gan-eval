1. Realism:   Artifacts/oddities on some photos (column 1 row 2, 3rd image chin)
                      Column 1, row 2, 3rd image looked photo shopped/model/makeup.
                      artifact right side of cheek (column 2, row 6, 3rd photo)
                      Various with oddities on forehead or another with another chin.
                      Others light/darkness background wash out features.
                      (while realistic to have photos be washed out, it lowers the realism)
2. Diversity:  
    Missing or under represented: Chinese, Japanese, South Korean, Indian, South American, Aboriginal Australian, Filipino, Middle East, and variations in each country.
    Also even if there was diversity most felt American or European.  
      - Think of a rice patty worker in remote Nepal, or fisherman small island in the Philippines.   Tibetan, Russia, Or think of people outside the city of Nigera, Kenya or Zimbawai versus Egyptian in Africa, or a city person in the US versus a farmer.
        (there are facial features from hard work, years of exposure to elements).
        Or Northern India, versus central India versus southern India (facial features and color vary), but their careers also vary peoples look (being weathered, areas of strength), weight.  I think most of these people were not over weight.  Perhaps 4-5 based on facial features.
       Chinese there are differences in regions and careers also.  (I think perhaps 3 Chinese)
       No Japanese or South Korean.  No Arabs (perhaps 1-2  mixed race) and there are a variety of Arabs/Middle Eastern decent. Middle East from Israel to Pakistan vary (and Pakistan/India overlap in looks.)  No Punjabi's or Dravidian's nor North Eastern Indians, only perhaps 2 other Indians.

And based on world wide population: China, India should be majority.
